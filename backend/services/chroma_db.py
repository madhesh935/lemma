        "Victim R. Suresh. Age 34, Male. Cause of Death: Blunt force trauma to the occipital region resulting in depressed skull fracture and subdural hemorrhage. Estimated TOD: 19:30 - 21:00.",
        "Autopsy A-2041 Findings: Lungs congested (right 520g, left 473g). Liver 1418g showing mild steatosis. Stomach contains partially digested rice and vegetables, suggesting last meal was around 18:00.",
        "Toxicology Report T-2041: Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) 0.04%. Trace amounts of diazepam detected. No other illicit substances found.",
        "Post-mortem interval indicators: Algor mortis rectal temperature 20.4°C at 23:30. Rigor mortis developing in jaw and neck. Livor mortis fixed on posterior surfaces, inconsistent with the supine recovery position, suggesting post-mortem relocation.",
        
        # Suspects
        "Suspect Vetri (S-118). Age 39. Known drug supplier with prior convictions for assault. Financial link to victim established. DNA connection via crime scene blood trace.",
        "Suspect Manoj (S-204). Age 28. Co-worker of the victim. Last seen near TOD window. Claims he was at a cafe in Egmore during the incident, but witness accounts conflict.",
        
        # Physical Evidence
        "Evidence EV-008: Blunt Object (Recovered). A rusted iron rod weighing 600g. Recovered from a storm drain 100m from the primary scene. Blood typing matches victim (O+). Partial latent fingerprint lifted from the handle.",
        "Fingerprint Analysis FP-09: Partial latent print from iron rod matches right thumb of Suspect Vetri (S-118). 12 minutiae points matched.",
        "DNA Sample D-77: Blood spatter collected from a brick wall at the crime scene. STR profiling shows a 99.2% match with Suspect Vetri (S-118).",
        
        # Timeline & Digital Forensics
        "CCTV-CHN-0412: Camera located at Chennai Central E-Gate 4. Footage from 20:42 shows a physical altercation between the victim and an unidentified male matching S-118's description. 6 clear frames captured before subjects move out of frame.",
        "CCTV-CHN-0418: Camera near Royapuram transit hub. Timestamp shows 20:48, but station logs indicate a +6 minute clock drift. Forensic review confirms actual time of capture was 20:42. Victim visible walking alone.",
        "Financial Record FIN-992: UPI Transfer of ₹40,000 from Victim R. Suresh to Suspect Vetri (S-118) at 20:22. Transaction memo left blank. Bank logs confirm successful transfer.",
        "Digital Forensics: WhatsApp extraction from Victim's phone. Last message sent at 19:45 to S-118: 'I have the money, meet me at the usual spot.'",
        "Cell Tower Dump CDR-881: Victim's phone pinged the Park Town cell tower (Tower ID: 4492) continuously from 20:14 to 20:51, after which the signal was lost (likely device destroyed or powered off).",
        "Cell Tower Dump CDR-882: Suspect Vetri (S-118)'s phone pinged the exact same Park Town cell tower (Tower ID: 4492) starting at 20:22 and leaving the sector at 20:55. High probability of spatial overlap.",
        
        # Environmental & Witnesses
        "Witness Statement W-01 (Anandhi K.): Local tea stall owner. Reliable witness. Confirms seeing the victim near E-Gate 4 at 20:14, looking agitated and checking his watch frequently.",
        "Witness Statement W-02 (Auto Driver T.): Claims to have dropped Suspect Manoj (S-204) near the scene at 22:10. However, this contradicts S-204's phone GPS data which places him in Adyar at that time. Statement flagged as low reliability.",
        "Weather Log WX-22: Overcast conditions, low visibility. Temperature 27°C, humidity 88%. No precipitation during the estimated TOD window."
